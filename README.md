gosimnet
========

gosimnet is a compact network simulator. It is minimal,
with a small code base and only two imports, to make
it useful for many test situations. It was written for 
testing with the new Go
testing/synctest facility, but
can run without it too. gosimnet implements the `net.Conn`
interface to networks. The test file
https://github.com/glycerine/gosimnet/blob/master/simnet_test.go
illustrates its use.

I wrote this originally for https://github.com/glycerine/rpc25519 
system testing (simulating network chaos), without
a net.Conn interface. Then I realized it might 
be more broadly useful. So I pulled it out and condensed it, adding
the net.Conn interface to allow testing regular Go networking
code. This hopefully will allow many to benefit
from https://pkg.go.dev/testing/synctest testing,
where talking to a real network is verboten.

The basic test here is just a minimal example. It
is meant to get you started.

The underlying rpc25519 package has an extensive 
test suite, and includes a full rsync-like protocol for
efficient filesystem sync. The underlying Simnet passes
all of those tests. They can be found in these files:

https://github.com/glycerine/rpc25519/blob/master/simnet_test.go

https://github.com/glycerine/rpc25519/blob/master/jsync/rsync_simnet_test.go

https://github.com/glycerine/rpc25519/blob/master/simgrid_test.go

A potentially suprising aspect

Network connection endpoints ("addresses")
at the moment are kept as simple as 
possible -- just a string.

You can interpret this string as the host name,
as a host + port, or make it opaque if 
you wish by letting it be the
a string like "127.0.0.1:8080", or even
let it be a whole URL. The system
does not care what the endpoint string is,
only that each endpoint has a unique name.

You must ensure this uniqueness across all
network nodes. Beyond that, the name can
be anything that makes your modeling easier.

Thus there is no need to emuate DNS to get
human readable addressing, and no network
specific address convention to emulate.
The convention of a server binding ":0" to get
a free port is not implemented (at the moment), as ports
are not really needed as a separate concept.

Servers and clients can be "multi-homed"
trivially, as their endpoint address is any 
string they choose.
