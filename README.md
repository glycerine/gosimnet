gosimnet
========

gosimnet is a compact network simulator. It is minimal,
with a small code base and only two imports, to make
it useful for many test situations. It was written for 
testing with the new Go
testing/synctest facility, but
can run without it too. gosimnet implements the `net.Conn`
interface to networks. The test file
https://github.com/glycerine/gosimnet/blob/master/simnet_test.go
illustrates its use.

I wrote this originally for https://github.com/glycerine/rpc25519 
system testing (simulating network chaos), without
a net.Conn interface. Then I realized it might 
be more broadly useful. So I pulled it out and condensed it, adding
the net.Conn interface to allow testing regular Go networking
code. This hopefully will allow many to benefit
from https://pkg.go.dev/testing/synctest testing,
where talking to a real network is verboten.

The basic test here is just a minimal example. It
is meant to get you started.

The underlying rpc25519 package has an extensive 
test suite, and includes a full rsync-like protocol for
efficient filesystem sync. The underlying Simnet passes
all of those tests. They can be found in these files:

type Alteration int 

    Alteration flags are used in 
    AlterCircuit() calls to specify 
    what change you want to a 
    specific network simnode.

const (
	UNDEFINED Alteration = 0
	SHUTDOWN  Alteration = 1
	POWERON   Alteration = 2
	ISOLATE   Alteration = 3
	UNISOLATE Alteration = 4
)


type DropDeafSpec struct {

	// false UpdateDeafReads means no change to deafRead
	// probability. The DeafReadsNewProb field is ignored.
	// This allows setting DeafReadsNewProb to 0 only
	// when you want to.
	UpdateDeafReads bool

	// probability of ignoring (being deaf) to a read.
	// 0 => never be deaf to a read (healthy).
	// 1 => ignore all reads (dead hardware).
	DeafReadsNewProb float64

	// false UpdateDropSends means the DropSendsNewProb
	// is ignored, and there is no change to the dropSend
	// probability.
	UpdateDropSends bool

	// probability of dropping a send.
	// 0 => never drop a send (healthy).
	// 1 => always drop a send (dead hardware).
	DropSendsNewProb float64
}

    DropDeafSpec specifies a network/netcard 
    fault with a given probability.



func (s *Simnet) AllHealthy(
    powerOnIfOff bool, 
    deliverDroppedSends bool,
    ) (err error)
    
    AllHealthy heal all partitions, undoes all faults, 
    network wide. All circuits
    are returned to HEALTHY status. Their powerOff 
    status is not updated unless
    powerOnIfOff is also true. See also RepairSimnode 
    for single simnode repair.

func (s *Simnet) AlterHost(
     simnodeName string, 
     alter Alteration,
     ) (undo Alteration, err error)
     
    we cannot guarantee that the undo will
    reverse all the changes if fine
    grained faults are in place; e.g. if only 
    one auto-cli was down and we
    shutdown the host, the undo of restart 
    will also bring up that auto-cli too.
    The undo is still very useful for tests 
    even without that guarantee.

func (s *Simnet) NewSimnetBatch(subwhen time.Time, subAsap bool) *SimnetBatch

func (s *Simnet) NoisyNothing(oldval, newval bool) (swapped bool)

    NoisyNothing makes simnet print/log if it 
    appears to have nothing to do at
    the end of each scheduling loop.

     originName string, 
     unIsolate bool, 
     powerOnIfOff bool,

     ) (err error)
     
    RepairCircuit restores the local 
    circuit to full working order.
    It undoes the effects of prior deafDrop 
    actions, if any. It does not change
    an isolated simnode's isolation unless 
    unIsolate is also true. See also
    RepairHost, AllHealthy. .

func (s *Simnet) RepairHost(
     originName string,

    RepairHost repairs all the circuits on the host.

func (s *Simnet) String() (r string)

func (s *Simnet) SubmitBatch(batch *SimnetBatch)

}
    SimnetBatch is a proposed design for 
    sending in a batch of network
    fault/repair/config changes at once. 
    Currently a prototype; not really
    finished/tested yet.

# naming -- suprisingly simple

Network connection endpoints ("addresses")
at the moment are kept as simple as 
possible -- just a string.

You can interpret this string as the host name,
as a host + port, or make it opaque if 
you wish by letting it be the
a string like "127.0.0.1:8080", or even
let it be a whole URL. The system
does not care what the endpoint string is,
only that each endpoint has a unique name.

You must ensure this uniqueness across all
network nodes. Beyond that, the name can
be anything that makes your modeling easier.

Thus there is no need to emuate DNS to get
human readable addressing, and no network
specific address convention to emulate.
The convention of a server binding ":0" to get
a free port is not implemented (at the moment), as ports
are not really needed as a separate concept.

Servers and clients can be "multi-homed"
trivially, as their endpoint address is any 
string they choose.
