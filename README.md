gosimnet
========

`gosimnet` is a compact network simulator. It is fairly minimal,
but still hopefully useful. It was written for testing with 
testing/synctest (which is very promising/exciting), but
can run without it too. gosimnet implements the `net.Conn`
interface to networks. The test file
https://github.com/glycerine/gosimnet/blob/master/simnet_test.go
illustrates its use.

I wrote this originally for https://github.com/glycerine/rpc25519 
system testing (simulating network chaos), without
a net.Conn interface. Then I realized it might 
be more broadly useful. So I pulled it out and condensed it, adding
a net.Conn interface, to make it potentially
usable for broader https://pkg.go.dev/testing/synctest testing.

Since synctest is in the experimental phase, 
getting early feedback in now to make it as
usable as possible would benefit all.

The net.Conn implementation in particular is
rough and ready. If you spot any issues, 
please let me know.
