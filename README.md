gosimnet
========

`gosimnet` is a compact network simulator. It is minimal,
with a small code base and only two imports, to make
it useful for many test situations. It was written for testing with 
testing/synctest (which is very promising/exciting), but
can run without it too. gosimnet implements the `net.Conn`
interface to networks. The test file
https://github.com/glycerine/gosimnet/blob/master/simnet_test.go
illustrates its use.

I wrote this originally for https://github.com/glycerine/rpc25519 
system testing (simulating network chaos), without
a net.Conn interface. Then I realized it might 
be more broadly useful. So I pulled it out and condensed it, adding
the net.Conn interface to allow testing regular Go networking
code. This hopefully will allow many to benefit
from https://pkg.go.dev/testing/synctest testing,
where talking to a real network is verboten.

Since synctest is in the experimental phase, 
getting early feedback in now to make it as
usable as possible would benefit the Go community.

Quality: high; ready for stress testing. I'm not aware of any issues,
but this needs additional real use. Bring on your tests;
please file any issues that you encounter, or
suggestions for improvements.

The test here is just a minimal example. I have
not brought other more punishing tests over 
to keep this package petite and approachable
at first; that does not reflect the true 
degree of testing that has been done.
